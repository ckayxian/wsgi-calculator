# WSGI Calculator

The WSGI calculator that you can use to add, subtract, multiply, or divide two numbers.

You'll use the calculator by visiting an address like: [http://localhost:8080/multiply/3/5](http://localhost:8080/multiply/3/5), then you would expect to see a page in your browser with the text "15".

## Try it out

The index page at the address http://localhost:8080/ would show you text instructions that explain how to use the site.

There is also a set of tests for you to run, using `python tests.py`.
